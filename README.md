## About
This is the project I made in 2016. It is made using html and javascript, with the P5 Library.
This project is where I fell in love with coding. I was so addicted, I spent an all nighter building this, 2 weeks before the deadline.

## How to run
Open "Ver9" (in "theActualGame" folder) and double click the ".html" file. It will run the game on a browser window.
